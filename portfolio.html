"PrakrutiProfiler:Revolutionizing Ayurvedic Health with an AI-Powered Self-Assessment Chatbot"
 Iam presently working on my major project and the problem statement is"PrakrutiProfiler:Revolutionizing Ayurvedic Health with an AI-Powered Self-Assessment Chatbot""dashboard prepreation
dashboard prepreation.I have the capacity to create a dashboard in power bi."machine learning convergence for weather based crop recommendation system
machine learning convergence for weather based crop recommendation system
It is useful for farmers for more yield and it is used to decide which crop is suitable for which type of weather conditions,we have used the parameters like n,p,k values ,temperature ,rainfall,humidity,etc we have used python and machine learning algorithms for my project like support vector machine,decision tree, classification,logistic regression. we have used the dataset which is taken from the kaggle of size 2200 label and we have taken 22 types of crops . each crop has 100 labels.we are used the anaconda navigator and jupyter notebook for the execution of my code.
